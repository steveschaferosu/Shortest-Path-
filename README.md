# Shortest-Path-
A program that computes the shortest path between two cities.
 * Program in which the user enters an expression in postfix notation (ex:5 10 1
 * + * 7 -). The user can then set the display to [P]ostfix,[I]nfix, or
 * p[R]efix. The output will display the correct calculation of the expression
 * using an ExpressionTree. At any point the user can select Q and end the
 * program .
 * This Expression Tree class contains a series of methods to perform on a TreeNode and create an ExpressionTree. 
 * The methods are: buildTreeFromString,toPostfixString, toInfixString,toPrefixString and evaluate.
